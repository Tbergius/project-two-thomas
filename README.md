# The Hogwarts quiz to find your house

## Introduction

Welcome to the Hogwarts House Quiz website! This project represents an exciting challenge in my journey to enhance my web development skills. The aim is to create an engaging and interactive platform where users can discover their Hogwarts house by taking a fun and informative quiz.

Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project offers an interesting user experience that captures some of the magic of the Harry Potter universe. Users will be able to take a quiz and receive a house assignment based on their answers.

In this README, I'll walk you through my journey getting to the live site. I hope you find this project both informative and enjoyable as you explore your Hogwarts house. Thank you for joining me on this magical journey!

## User Experience

- As a visiting user, I would like to have a fun experience to get a Hogwarts House without doing a lot of reading
- As a visiting user, I would like to not get distracted by extra information on the page
- As a visiting user, I would like to get my house assigned without going through a ton of questions
- As a returning user, I would like to see how my different answers affect my house sorting
- As a returning user, I would be happy to see that my house stays the same if I choose the same answers

## Features

### Pages

There is one page, the main page. As such, no menu, header, or footer is added. It is a simplistica layout, making sure the quiz stands out

---
## Design

The site has a simplistic aproach to ensure the quiz is easy to navigate, and the user is not distracted by other information. 

### Colour Scheme

I knew I wanted a dark page as the initial design, and I chose a gold color for the letters as this looked amazing on one of the other pages I looked at for inspiration. That page was made by Michael Bergmann and can be found here: [https://codepen.io/ice_bergmann/pen/vmjWqg] (https://codepen.io/ice_bergmann/pen/vmjWqg)

### Typography

I chose the EB Garamond font from Google Fonts as that showed as one of the top results when searching for Harry Potter fonts. And I liked what I saw!

### Favicon

The icon was found via Google image search, and modified via favicon.io

## Wireframes

Initially I made a rough sketch of what I wanted, and reasonably quick came to the realisation that I want a simple page. Not too much fluff, just the quiz. As such, I did not create any wireframes and kept the Love Maths project in mind making the design.
